# TuneText
Welcome to TuneText!  TuneText is a website to pair a song to a user's provided text.  Using machine learning NLTK models, text can be classified into an emotion.  The text will then be paired with a fitting song!

`secret-example.txt` shows how to format the `secret.txt` file.

## Running the Application
Start the website easily on your local machine with `docker-compose up`

The website can be viewed at `localhost:4200`
